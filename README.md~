## Opening data files
* When you are running the model in julia, make sure you set the working directory to your current file location to be able to open the data files. 
	* From the menu at top, click Juno -> Working Directory -> Current File's folder
	
## Papers
* These are some papers that I found useful doing CA2 and this group assignment. If you come across any relevant papers, let me know and I can upload it here.
	
* Install Gurobi (faster optimizer) here: https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/ (follow the instructions for 'Individual Academic Licenses')
	* If you don't have Gurobi installed, just replace Gurobi with Cbc and it should work fine too.
